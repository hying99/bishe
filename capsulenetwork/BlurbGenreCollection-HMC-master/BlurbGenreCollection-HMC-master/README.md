# Hierarchical classification of text with capsule networks

Capsule networks have been shown to demonstrate good performance on structured data in the area of visual inference. 
This repository enables the application of and comparison between simple shallow capsule networks for hierarchical multi-label text classification and other traditional neural networks, such as CNNs and LSTMs, and non-neural network architectures such as SVMs.
For our experiments, we use the established Web of Science (WOS) dataset and introduce a new real-world scenario dataset, the BlurbGenreCollection (BGC).

Our results confirm the hypothesis that capsule networks are especially advantageous for rare events and structurally diverse categories, which we attribute to their ability to combine latent encoded information. Details on the experiments and results as well as an extensive analysis can be found in the following scientific publication:

The dataset published with this scientific work, namely BlurbGenreCollection, consists of book blurbs and their respective hierarchically structured writing genres. The datset can be downloaded on the [Language Technology page of the Universit√§t Hamburg](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/blurb-genre-collection.html).

# System Requirement

The system was tested on Debian/Ubuntu Linux with a GTX 1080TI and TITAN X.

# Installation

1. Clone repository: 

  ```
  https://github.com/Raldir/BlurbGenreCollection_Classification.git
  ```
  
2. Install a dataset

   1. Either the BlurbGenreCollection-Dataset:

      ```
      cd BlurbGenreCollection_Classification && wget https://fiona.uni-hamburg.de/ca89b3cf/blurbgenrecollectionen.zip && unzip blurbgenrecollectionen.zip -d datasets
      ```
  
   2. Or install your own Dataset:
   
       The abstract class `loader_abstract` needs to be extended by your custom class that loads your dataset. Please adjust the return values of the methods to match the descriptions. The method `load_data_multiLabel()` should return a list of three sets: train, dev and test. Each collection is a list of tuples with each tuple being `(String, Set of Strings)` for the text and its respective set of labels. 
       
The method `read_relations()` only needs to be implemented if a hierarchy exists. It should contain two sets -- the first consists of relation-pairs `(parent, child)` as Strings and the second set contains genres that have neither a parent nor a child. Furthermore, replace the following line with the name of your new loader_class: ` data_helpers.py: Line 15`. For further reference, please take a look at `loader.py` which loads the BlurbGenreCollection dataset.
      Finally, `read_all_genres` stores co_occurences in a file to make the loading process quicker -- if the dataset changes please adjust the name so that the correct co_occurences are being loaded (only for label hierarchy relevant).
         

  
3. Install project packages:

```
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```
 
 4. Further packages needed:
 ```
pip install stop-words
python -m spacy download en
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
 ```
 
5. Install word embeddings for the English language, e.g.:
```
mkdir resources && cd resources && wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.en.vec
``` 
We recommend to put them into a ./resources folder. Please ensure to adjust the path and filename in case you decide to use different embeddings/path.

# Hierarchical Multi-label Classification

Running the main.py will run the complete Pipeline if in train mode: Loading the data, preprocessing and training the classifier. 
The preprocessed data is stored in the resources folder, to save time in sequential runs. Same applies to the computation of the embedding matrix, which is stored for a fixed sequence length.

| Option |  Description | Default|
|--------|-------------|---|
| --mode | Mode, e.g. train and test on validation or test on test set (train_test) | train_validation |
| --classifier | Select between CNN, LSTM and capsule | capsule |
| --lang | Datset to be used | EN |
| --level| Max Genre Level of the hierarchy| 1 |

The level setting can only be used if the program is provided with a hierarchy, otherwise the networks handle the data as a traditional multi-label classification task.

General Settings:

| Option |  Description | Default|
|--------|-------------|---|
| --sequence_length | Maximum sequence imput length of text | 100 |
| --epochs | Number of epochs to train the classifier | 60 |
| --use_statc | Whether the embedding layer should not be trainable | False |
| --use_early_stop |Uses early stopping during training | False |
| --batch_size |Set minibatch size | 32 |
| --learning_rate |The learning rate of the classifier | 0.0005 |
| --learning_decay |Whether to use learning decay, 1 indicates no decay, 0 max.| 1 |
| --init_layer |Whether to initialize the final layer with label co-occurence.| False |
| --iterations |How many classifiers to be trained, only relevant for train_n_models_final | 3 |
| --activation_th |Activation threshold of the final layer | 0.5 |
| --adjust_hierarchy |Postprocessing hierarchy correction | None|
| --correction_th |Threshold for threshold-label correction method | False |

Please note, that `--init_layer, --correction_th --adjust_hierarchy` are only usable, if the hierarchy of a dataset is given as input as well.


Capsule settings:

| Option |  Description | Default|
|--------|-------------|---|
| --dense_capsule_dim |Dimensionality of capsules on final layer| 16 |
| --n_channels | Number of capsules per feature map | 50 |

LSTM settings:

| Option |  Description | Default|
|--------|-------------|---|
| --lstm_units | Number of units in the lstm | 700 |

CNN settings:

| Option |  Description | Default|
|--------|-------------|---|
| --num_filters | Number of filters for each window size | 500 |


*Example:*  
`python3.5 main.py --mode train_validation --classifier cnn --lang EN --sequence_length 100 --learning_rate 0.001 --learning_decay 1
